### Aurora
* 5 times faster then MySQL 
* Start with 5 GB to 10 GB, 32vCpu, 244 GB memory
* 2 copies of data in one AZ, 3 AZs
* 2 types of replica, Aurora Replica, MySQL replica
* Up to 15 read replica
* Aurora PostgreSQL does not currently support cross-region replicas.

### RDS
* Automated backup is enabled by default
* Snapshots are created manually 
* Restore creates a new instance
* Multi AZs is for disaster recovery, read replica is to improve performance.
* Read replica is not available for SQL Server and Oracle database.
* Max size is 16TB for SQL Server.
* When RDS is doing a backup the IO may be briefly suspended.
* Changes to RDS backup window takes effect immediately.
* Up to 5 read replica 
* Encryption of existing RDB instance is not supported, you have to create a snapshot of the instance, encrypt the snapshot and restore from the encrypted copy. 
* Backup can be kept up to 35 days.
* Multi AZ use synchronous synchronisation for standby instance.
* Read replica use asynchronous synchronisation.
* Read replica can be in a different region.

### ElasticCache 
* Memcache 
* Redis 

### DynamoDB
* Value cannot exceeds 400kb.
* Spread 3 different data centers. It is automatically replicated across multiple AZs.
* By default it is eventual consistent read. It can support strongly consistent read with a higher cost.

### Redshift
* A single node can have 160 GB data.
* Up to 128 compute node.
* Only support in one AZ.
* Columnar data storage.
