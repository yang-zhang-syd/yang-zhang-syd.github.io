<!-- **Backend**
:   Proficient at using ASP.Net MVC, Web API. Have experience with Java Spring & Spring boot.
<br/><br/>
**Frontend**
:   **Angular:** Use Angular since 2014. 
<br/><br/>
:   **React:** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want
    to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to
    mention some others together at the end. A format that works well
    here is a description list where the first few items have their
    first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few
    emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf
    version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html. -->
